        <p>Hi, I'm Lachlan.</p>

        <h1>My Websites</h1>
        <p>You can't have a tour around my world without talking about one of my most boring hobbies.. 
            <br>My crippling addiction of buying website domains that I have no use for (but like to collect like pokemon cards)!
            <br><br>
            Take a click on each domain to visit them, or click the tag around them to see more info about how/why I chose it!

        <p class="domainDesc" id="lachlau_desc">
            One of the more recent addition to my collection, a 'generic TLD' that is the closest to my name that was able to be grabbed. I bought this domain on the day that the .au domain was able to be bought from directly

            The very first domain I bought, 
            I am pretty sure I found this domain based off my username on social media / gaming accounts, however I cannot guarentee the order of that since I think the domain and the username came about at around the same time, moving on from my original username I had since I started playing Club Penguin in 2009.

            After spending a bit of time with my original doamin, and having to manually spell out (time and time again) I went looking for another domain I could use with any combination of my first/last name. Unfortunately, since both of them are common enough I spent ages looking and never found anything. Luckily, this domain showed itself after some time on a new registrar (Porkbun) that I have since moved all* domains accross to.

            The shortest domain I own, found by searching specifically for the shortest unreserved domains on the internet (that also didnt cost $100s per year to keep). I eventually found two (that were pronouncable), and settled on this one after some thought and due to it being a XXXXXX of two names, "ollie"
