        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Lachlan.</p>
        <br>

        <!-- <h2>Unsolicited advice about starting to learn to code</h2>
        <p></p> -->



        <!--Make each of these websites expandable for more information (no links -- links should be on the expander)-->
        <h1>My Websites</h1>
        <p>My most crippling addiction is that of buying website domains that I have no use for (but like to collect like pokemon cards)!</p>

        <h4 class="titleBeforeSubtitle">Personal Domains</h4>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Domains using variations of my name (which is Lachlan in case you forgot)</h6>

        <p><a href="https://lachl.au"><i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie"></i>  lachl.au</a> - Portfolio</p>
        <p>One of the more recent addition to my collection, a 'generic TLD' that is the closest to my name that was able to be grabbed. I bought this domain on the day that the .au domain was able to be bought from directly </p>

        <p><a href="https://lacln.com"><i class="fa-solid fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> lacln.com</a> - Legacy Portfolio</p>
        <p>The very first domain I bought, 
            I am pretty sure I found this domain based off my username on social media / gaming accounts, however I cannot guarentee the order of that since I think the domain and the username came about at around the same time, moving on from my original username I had since I started playing Club Penguin in 2009.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://moore.moe"><i class="fa-solid fa-earth-oceania"></i> moore.moe</a> - Family Site</p>
        <p>After spending a bit of time with my original doamin, and having to manually spell out (time and time again) I went looking for another domain I could use with any combination of my first/last name. Unfortunately, since both of them are common enough I spent ages looking and never found anything. Luckily, this domain showed itself after some time on a new registrar (Porkbun) that I have since moved all* domains accross to.</p>
<!--create a tooltip for the asterisk here-->
        <p><a href="https://llan.au"><i class="fa-solid fa-flask"></i> llan.au</a> - General Use</p>
        <p>Another domain I bought when the .au TLD allowed for when direct domians were able to be ordered, however this one has a story behind it. I originally found </p>

        <p><a href="https://lachlan.zip"><i class="fa-regular fa-file-zipper"></i> lachlan.zip</a> - Unused</p>
        <p>When the </p>

        <h4 class="titleBeforeSubtitle">Misc Domains</h4>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Domains that have a general rarity / specialty</h6>

        <p><a href="https://ohh.li"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> ohh.li</a> - Link Shortner</p>
        <p>The shortest domain I own, found by searching specifically for the shortest unreserved domains on the internet (that also didnt cost $100s per year to keep). I eventually found two (that were pronouncable), and settled on this one after some thought and due to it being a XXXXXX of two names, "ollie"</p><i> and another that held more significance at that time, and still exists hidden on the site as an easter egg.</i>

        <p><a href="https://sussy.zip"><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i> sussy.zip</a> - Automation Tooling</p>
        <p>When the '.zip' TLD became a buyable domain, I could barely believe it was allowed, considering the already used namespace for the file type and how </p>

        <p><a href="https://000800.xyz"><i class="fa-solid fa-house-signal"></i> 000800.xyz</a> - General Use Home Automation</p>
        <p>When looking through the $1 'xyz' domains, I found this one and </p>

        <p><a href="https://1100011.xyz"><i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> 1100011.xyz</a> - General Use Programming</p>
